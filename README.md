## Resources that have helped me in the past:

* [Software Carpentry Foundation](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)  - covers both local and remote repositories

* [VSCode and Git](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)

## Other resources that might be useful 

[LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=git&u=74653818)  - Access to LinkedIn learning is available through the University of Manchester Software Centre. They have a range of tutorials if you search for Git or Github

[Git tutorials from atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) - I found these tutorials good. They're bit bucket based but still git. Spend a day going through these tutorials and you should get the basics.

## For writing documentation in GitHub (e.g., README files)

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


## Setting up SSH keys
